<p>This is a tiny program that uses pygame, and doesn't actually do much. But it's a start!</p>

<p>First we "import" pygame. This is because pygame is
    what we call a "library". Think of it as a plugin
    for the programming language.</p>

<p>After that, we have to tell pygame to get started. This
    is done simply by calling <code>pygame.init()</code>.</p>

<p>Then we have to create a game window. A game window can have
    any size we want, so we need to tell Pygame what will be the
    height and width of the window in pixels. We do that using
    <code>pygame.display.set_mode(...)</code>.</p>

<p>Now can start drawing.
    However, for this first lesson we'll just end here and
    close the game window, using <code>pygame.display.quit()</code>.
    We'll get to that drawing part later!</p>
